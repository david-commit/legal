## Deployment

> Bycrpt is the technology used in authentication of users.

> Sessions (cookies) are used to enable the application to maintain user-specific state, while users interact with the application. For example, sessions allow users to authenticate once and remain signed in for future requests.

The whole application (FE and BE) will have to be bundled into a monolith application and deployed as one. This has been tried and tested on Railway.app and works as expected.

Reason being, sessions do not work cross platforms eg having the FE deployed on Vercel and BE on Render but works on the same site deployment.

To deploy both as one, on the FE, run ```npm run build``` and copy all the files created in the build folder and paste them in the `public` folder of the backend. 

You can now deploy the application. [Documentation on deploying the BE on Railway.app](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eYrPpAhOO7HGV7qCc-z5WTiVzrs4cnaJIZe9OJoz6PY/edit?usp=sharing).
